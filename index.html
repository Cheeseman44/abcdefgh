    <h2>My Dearest Hana,</h2>

 <p>
        I’ve been thinking about this for a long time.
        Every time I try to say it in person, I get nervous —
        because what I feel is real.
    </p>

    <p>
        Somewhere between our small talks,
        shared laughs, and random moments…
        you slowly became someone very important to me.
    </p>

    <p>
        I admire your kindness, your smile,
        and the way you make ordinary days feel special.
        Being around you makes me feel calm,
        happy, and inspired.
    </p>

    <p>
        I don’t know what the future holds,
        but I know one thing —
        I genuinely like you.
    </p>

    <p>
        This isn’t a joke.
        This isn’t just a Valentine thing.
        This is me being honest with my feelings.
    </p>

    <h3 class="final-line">
        I like you… and I hope you can give me a chance. 💖
